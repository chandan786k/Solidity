MyToken Solidity Smart Contract

This Solidity program is a basic token contract that demonstrates essential token functionalities, including minting and burning tokens. It serves as a foundational example for those new to Solidity and token development.

Description
This program is a simple token contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract maintains details about the token, including its name, abbreviation, and total supply. It allows for minting and burning tokens, and keeps track of balances associated with addresses.

Getting Started
Executing the Program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. Follow these steps:

Go to Remix:

Visit the Remix website at Remix Ethereum.
Create a New File:

Click on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar.
Save the file with a .sol extension (solidity.sol).
Copy and Paste the Code:

solidity
Copy code
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.26;

contract MyToken {
    // public variables here
    string public tokenname = "crypto";
    string public tokenAbrrv = "Alpha";
    uint public totaltoken = 0;

    // mapping variable here
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    // mint function
    function mint(address _address, uint value) public {
        balances[_address] += value;
        totaltoken += value;
    }

    // burn function
    function burn(address _address, uint value) public {
        require(balances[_address] >= value, "Insufficient balance to burn");
        balances[_address] -= value;
        totaltoken -= value;
    }
}
Compile the Code:

Click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar.
Ensure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.26" (or another compatible version).
Click on the "Compile solidity.sol" button.

Deploy the Contract:

Click on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar.
Select the "solidity" contract from the dropdown menu.
Click on the "Deploy" button.
Interact with the Contract:

After deployment, you can mint tokens by calling the mint function with an address and value.
You can burn tokens by calling the burn function with an address and value, provided the balance is sufficient.
Functions
Mint Function

solidity
Copy code
function mint(address _address, uint value) public {
    balances[_address] += value;
    totaltoken += value;
}
Description: Increases the total supply and the balance of the specified address.

Parameters:
_address: The address to which the tokens will be minted.
value: The number of tokens to be minted.
Burn Function

solidity
Copy code
function burn(address _address, uint value) public {
    require(balances[_address] >= value, "Insufficient balance to burn");
    balances[_address] -= value;
    totaltoken -= value;
}
Description: Decreases the total supply and the balance of the specified address, provided the address has enough tokens.

Parameters:
_address: The address from which the tokens will be burned.

value: The number of tokens to be burned.

Requirements: The balance of the specified address must be greater than or equal to the number of tokens to be burned.
